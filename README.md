- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++, TCP/IP, Kubernetes, POSIX, and Fine Grained Authorization 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Golang libraries, maybe Kernel development, Cloud Frameworks, and anything that brings value. Sure AI stuff as well.
- 📫 How to reach me IDK ... will come back to this.
- 😄 Pronouns: WTF IS THIS SHIT BRUH. 
- ⚡ Fun fact: APC9K is super smooth.
