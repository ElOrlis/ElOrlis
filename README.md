# 🫡 El Orlis
- 👀 I’m interested in Guns, Books, Clean Code, Networking, Cloud, Kernels, Golang, C/C++, Rust, and Low Latency 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C/C++ (Refresher and C++20), TCP/IP, Kubernetes (cuz certificates matter?), POSIX, and Fine Grained Auth Protocols
- 💻 I’m looking to collaborate on Golang libraries, maybe Kernel development, Cloud Frameworks, and anything that brings value. Sure AI stuff as well.
- 📫 How to reach me IDK ... will come back to this.
- ⚡ Fun fact: APC9K is super smooth 🔫
